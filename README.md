# Subtle UI

Subtle UI is a growing library of simple, accessible, and subtly beautiful web components. Currently available as TailwindCSS classes written in plain HTML (standalone CSS version also coming soon), it supports light and dark modes.

## Components

### Navbar

Navbar is a fixed position, navigation bar that is fully responsive down to viewports as small as 320px (smaller if links are swapped out for a hamburger menu).

## Installation
1. Install <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a>, if you haven't already. Note: Subtle UI uses the latest stable version of TailwindCSS. As of Friday May 31, 2024, that is v3.4.3. Please make sure to upgrade TailwindCSS to the latest version to ensure that all styling properties work as intended. The plan is to continue to support the latest stable version of TailwindCSS, so if you encounter issues, upgrading your TailwindCSS version will be a great first step to troubleshoot.
2. Copy and paste the `<nav>` content from the <a href="https://github.com/maxburnside/subtle_ui/blob/main/v1/components/navbar_with_tailwindcss.html" target="_blank">navbar_with_tailwind.html component file</a> into your project
3. Enjoy!

You can optionally use the demo content if you'd like. It's there to make it easier to see the fixed positioning, backdrop-filter blur and hover effect styling of the navbar.

Found any issues with the components? Please submit an issue on GitHub and I'll take a look at soon as I can.
